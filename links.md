The host explains various concepts in a very easy way ton understand with helpful visuals that help break down the topic.
2. [Regex Cheat Sheet](https://www.rexegg.com/regex-quickstart.html). This link gives you a cheat sheet for basic regex. It's pretty comprehensive and it helps when
I forget a concept or two. The table isn't confusing because thw writer explains the purpose of each column and it's organized in groups which makes finding
a particular concept easier.
