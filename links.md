### Here are some links that I think are pretty useful :D

1. [Operating Systems explanation video by Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26QPDBe-NB8). This is a YouTube video that discusses the basics of operating systems. 
The host explains various concepts in a very easy way ton understand with helpful visuals that help break down the topic.
2. [Regex Cheat Sheet](https://www.rexegg.com/regex-quickstart.html). This link gives you a cheat sheet for basic regex. It's pretty comprehensive and it helps when
I forget a concept or two. The table isn't confusing because thw writer explains the purpose of each column and it's organized in groups which makes finding
a particular concept easier.
3. [Vim basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggSyF1SVFr4). This YouTube video gives a quick rundown on the basics of using vim editor. The tutorial is easy to understand and it's split up into parts so you can just skip to a part you want to learn. It's helpful if you want to learn basics such as quitting vim, searching text, replacing text, etc.
4. [Debuggex](https://www.debuggex.com/). This is a regex visualization tool. You type in the regex at the top box, and your test data in the bottom text box, while the top-most box can show you the visualization of th regex. This really helped me in understanding how the regex syntax work, as it actually shows the regex pattern to help me better understand it.
5. [Cybersecurity Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPVaOlJ6ln0). This another helpful video by Crash Course that gives a comprehensive introduction to Cybersecurity. Like most Crash Course videos, it's pretty easy to understand and the visuals are very engaging.
6. [C Guidebook](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-c-beginners-handbook/). This is a quick guidebook for the language C. It's pretty beginner friendly and explains concepts well. So, it's a good place to take a peek when I'm forgetting a simple concept and need a refresher.
7. [File System Basics](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-file-system.htm). This is website that explains the file system of UNIX/LINUX. It explains the directory structure, commands that are useful to navigate the file system, and the concept of mounting.
8. [Memory-Mapped Files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPIhoJ6lKeQ). This is a youtube video that explains about memmory mapped files. Neil Rhodes explains the concept pretty well, and how to use operations such as Open, Seek, Read and Write.
9. [Education 4u OS Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKS34cSMNaXaySe2xgXH-3A/playlists). This is a playlist from a Youtube channel called Education 4u. It covers multiple operating systems topics and it gives comprehensive examples on different types of problems.
10. [Page Replacement Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VOYx3-JOnM&list=PLrjkTql3jnm9U1tSPnPQWQGIGNkUwBFv-&index=25). This is a video by Education 4u about page replacement. It's pretty easy to understand and the teacher gives case studies.
11. [Page Replacement FIFO Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16kaPQtYo28&list=PLrjkTql3jnm9U1tSPnPQWQGIGNkUwBFv-&index=26). This is a video on the FIFO page replacement algorithm. The teacher is not rushed in explaining it, and starts by giving a refresher on what page hit and page miss are. 
12. [Page Reolacement LRU Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23ROrlSK_g&list=PLrjkTql3jnm9U1tSPnPQWQGIGNkUwBFv-&index=27). This video explains the LRU page replacement algorithm. It explains how to do it step-by-step so it doesn't leave any confusions on how to do the problem.
13. [Page Reolacement OPTIMAL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeJIKKQcqpU&list=PLrjkTql3jnm9U1tSPnPQWQGIGNkUwBFv-&index=28). This is a video on the OPTIMAL page replacement algorithm. Again, Education 4u is really good at explaining how to do the algorithm, and the examples given cover all the bases so I was not left wondering on how I should approach different problems.
14. [Process vs Thread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dhf-DYO1K78). This is a video on the differences in process and thread. It helped me visualize process and threading in a bigger picture.
